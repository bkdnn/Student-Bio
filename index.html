This is a silly student bio page about me. My ultimate goal is to be able to code web apps that solve my day to day work problems. I think that, generally speaking, programmatic approaches
are the best way to solve recurring issues rather than manual grunt work. Once I have established a quick workflow and the ability to create enterprise level applications
I would like to design an application using the Open BIM API. This application would allow facility managers to view, track, and manipulate IFC data with a 3D model of their
properties in the browser. This sort of project will require quite a bit of interdisciplinary concepts such as: front end, back end, BIM, and a strong understanding
of good UI/UX designs. Although there are existing products in the market, they are clunky and very difficult to use. Once IoT truly makes a splash in the AEC industry, 
facility management platforms will be ubiquitous.
